        Passionate about the realms of Machine Learning, Android, and Artificial Intelligence, I find immense joy in the art of crafting scalable software systems.
<br>
I had the privilege of spending two years at Samsung Research, Bangalore, contributing to the SmartThings Application on WearOS Galaxy watches. I've been fortunate to play a part in innovations that have led to the recent commercialization of several patents and novel features.
<br>
My current journey involves pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at USC, where I am wholeheartedly dedicated to deepening my understanding of AI systems. 
<br>
I also work as Research Assistant at the ML division of WiDeS lab. My focus revolves around the exploration of how CNNs can be harnessed to predict signal pathloss in the dynamic landscape of urban areas.

<br>
While I may not possess expert guitar-playing skills, I relish the opportunity to pick up my dependable old Yamaha, join others in song, and jam together! It intrigues me how music, a primal form of expression, evolved over time as humans incorporated rhythmic melodies into their vocalizations, adding grammar and structure while preserving space for individuality and creativity.
