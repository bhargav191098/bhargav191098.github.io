        <br>Passionate about the realms of <b> Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence Systems</b>, I find immense joy in the art of crafting scalable software systems.
<br><br>
I had the privilege of spending two years at Samsung Research, Bangalore, contributing to the SmartThings Application on WearOS Galaxy watches. I've been fortunate to play a part in innovations that have led to the recent commercialization of several patents and novel features.
<br><br>
I look at Deep learning as a craft of sorts. It is a multifaceted problem statement. To become a good craftsman at one of its facets, is one of my long term dreams. Gonna fail a lot, learn a lot. Nvidia is a great place to do this I believe.
