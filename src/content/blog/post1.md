I believe writing is thinking clearly. As humans, we have tendencies to believe that we have learnt something but when asked to explain, we often find better ways to understand the problem itself. Sometimes this has happened to me, while I'm explaining. So I want to tap into this situation more often! I'm going to write tiny snippets of things I try to understand! Maybe it becomes into something I find my routine in or yet another pet project of mine whose aspirational qualities far outweigh their practicality! 

I'm currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science. I have taken up Foundations of AI and Analysis of Algorithms till now. I'm taking DSCI 552:Machine Learning and CSCI 585: Database Systems this semester and I believe I'll write about the concept I pick up at these classes.

I'm also a Research Assistant at the Wireless Devices and Systems Lab. It is really exciting to work on Computer Vision models. Some days I get to read classical papers and implement them using Pytorch! I'll also write about these experiences on this blog!

I'm also a devoted cinephile! I thoroughly enjoy watching remarkable movies that strike a chord with me, and occasionally, I might share a post or two about the films that captivate me.

Cheers and Fight on!
